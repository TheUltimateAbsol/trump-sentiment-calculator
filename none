1324534631245484034 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <TwystedElegance> So Biden hasn‚Äôt actually locked in AZ?
1324534631203483648 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <miacwoIucci> e eu achando que biden ia perder
1324534631098683393 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <USCesq> Well Mother did (formerly known as Pence). Go #Biden !
1324534631085957120 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <imquitescared> damn there will be a lot of twitter g*y n*des on here when Biden wins GA
1324534631035596801 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <Amgrand8> @newsmax @DonaldJTrumpJr @RichardGrenell @stinchfield1776 And I noticed peculiarities about the map of nevada and other statistical phenomena that lead me to think my state of Nevada may be in the bag with Biden. All just simple stuff.
1324534630737879042 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <Matt_M_626> @SoCal_Ray27 And Pennsylvania, I just want all the leads to hold up for Biden
1324534630498897921 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <AnneBradbury5> @KeystoneDem I hope @JohnFetterman runs for governor.  Either Shapiro or DePasquale for Senate. I wonder who Biden will choose for AG. I vote for @AdamSchiff.
1324534630431817728 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <StephenKing_BR> Diferen√ßa entre Biden e Trump diminuiu para 2,497 votos na Georgia, agora. 98% das urnas apuradas.
1324534630289084416 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <Chopstyx13> So are Alaska just chilling out waiting to see if Biden gets Nevada or Georgia so they won't have to bother counting the rest of their votes?
1324534630033346561 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <LiliaCouto75> @CassiaBrando4 N√£o,  continuam roubando e enfiando votos pro Biden
1324534629815103488 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <jasonrantz> Joe Biden lead in AZ over @realDonaldTrump has just been cut down from about 59k to about 46k.

1324534629605453830 2020-11-05 21:10:39 -0500 <chickwerner> @MJ_Mouton @N_y_d_d I think AZ, GA, NC &amp; NV will wait &amp; let #Pennsylvania put #BidenHarris go over the 270 electoral vote mark since #JoeBiden is from Scranton, PA, &amp; Dr. Jill Biden was raised in #Philadelphia.
1324534629349687299 2020-11-05 21:10:38 -0500 <bak_la_vah> will lyin biden and camal spare-us denounce anti-phucks and fake blmers
1324534629043490819 2020-11-05 21:10:38 -0500 <caguyer1971> @realDonaldTrump So here it is AZ will be reversed to you that would mean 11 points would be taken back putting Biden at 253 and you at 224 so Navada at play 6 points either way you or Biden but you probably then it goes to the other 3 undecided three which your lead currently you win win!
1324534628892450818 2020-11-05 21:10:38 -0500 <joejohnscnn> Joe Biden now has more votes cast for any american presidential candidate in history ‚ÄîJohn King

1324534627327946752 2020-11-05 21:10:38 -0500 <brihana25> @bergopolis They want to call Joe Biden's name first.  They want to erase what they've been doing the past four years and write themselves into the history books.
